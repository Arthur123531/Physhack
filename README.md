Attention all citizens of Earth! Deadly asteroid crashes are imminent! Thankfully, new lunar technology has enabled YOU to protect your planet by changing the Moon's orbit and speed. Are you up to the challenge?

This brand new game allows the user to test the limits of orbital mechanics by allowing changes to the initial conditions of our best buddy the moon. With its dynamic game play, the user can deviate asteroid orbits or induce crashes into the Moon, keeping the Earth protected from harm.

Launch the game by running `game.py`. 

The game includes menu screens, and a tutorial. 

Increase or decrease the moon's distance from the Earth with the up and down arrow keys. Accelerate or decelerate the Moon's motion by using the w and s keys. The game solves for the gravitational interactions between all the bodies at every step of the process, in other words, the n-body problem. 

The goal is to prevents asteroids from hitting the Earth, you win by surviving 100 seconds, and lose by having 10 asteroids collide with the Earth. Failure is also upon you if the moon collides with the Earth or floats too far off screen.
